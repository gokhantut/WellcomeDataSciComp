Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection -assisted clustering workflow:

referenceStudy.R
	- reads in Nanostring expression data
	- increased dimensionality is challenging for clustering algorithms so compression and noise reduction helps
	- capture nonlinearities with UMAP dimensionality reduction to 2D (can use mixed numerical and categorical data so include age/demographics etc)
	- identify subgroups that predict protection
	- returns the model allowing new data to be added to an existing embedding
	- can optimise D selection with scree plot and BIC metrics

umap_GMM_predict.R
	- Unsupervised clustering uses probabilistic model that assumes data is generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions
	- can optimise K (number of mixture components) by silhouette width

hai_identify_protected.R
	- having identified clusters then asses which clusters associate with protection by antibody readout
	- finds which Nanostring + demographic data defined clusters ultimately had antibody reponse post vaccine

byCluster_profiles.R
	- taking assigned cluster labels and profiling these in other datasets having the same individuals
	- this can identify other readouts that are correlates of the protective cluster
	- in this case we look at RNA expression
